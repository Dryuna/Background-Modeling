Background-Modeling
===================

Background modeling using Gaussian Mixture Model - C++

Background model for each pixel is constructed with a number of Gaussian componets, which are dynamically updated by new incoming pixels. With GMM, this background model can adapt to slow background changes and is also robust to small replicate background changes such as leaves swinging.

For detailed usage, please refer to main.cpp.
